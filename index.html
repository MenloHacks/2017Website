                <h1>A Brief History</h1>
                <p>In 2016, we hosted the first edition of MenloHacks from April 16-17. MenloHacks 2016 saw memorable events from cup stacking to a League of Legends tournament to the timed Menlo School tradition tapé where participants attempt to a roll blue masking tape down the courtyard into our student center. The first MenloHacks also kept participants well fed and energized from French Press Philz coffee to Doughbies Cookies to custom-made crêpes. At the end, hackers demoed their hacks to a panel of world-renowed judges from established industry titan Scott Forstall, the former SVP of iOS at Apple to up and comers like Brienne Ghafourfiar, the youngest person to ever raise $1 million in venture capital having done so at age 17. The winner was <a href="http://devpost.com/software/uber-scheduler">Uber Scheduler</a> which allowed users to schedule ubers in advance––before Uber implemented the same feature. You can see all of last year’s hacks at <a href="http://menlohacks.devpost.com">menlohacks.devpost.com</a> and check out last year's website at <a href="http://2016.menlohacks.com">2016.menlohacks.com</a>. </p>
                <p>To get a sense of last year and what to expect this year, here’s the summary video from last year.

                <h1>What's New for MenloHacks II?</h1>
                <p>
                    For MenloHacks II, we are focusing on improving the quality of the hacking. We are going to keep what made the original MenloHacks great from fantastic activities to top-notch food, but focus on the ins/outs of hacking. What does that mean? Mentors. For MenloHacks II we are going to focus on saturating the room with mentors. If you want a mentor, you will have a mentor. With that in mind, we are developing a custom mentoring system to facilitate the discovery process of mentors to make sure mentors can find mentees. If you are interested in mentoring, shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:mentor@menlohacks.com">mentor@menlohacks.com.</a></p>
                <p>
                    We are also going to be hosting even more workshops. Last year saw workshops ranging from Introduction to iOS Development to Java as a server-side language to Introduction to the Afero IoT platform. Expect there to be more workshops in more areas.

                            <p>What is a hackathon?</p> 
                        </header>
                        <p>In this context, the word "hack" means to create. A hackathon is an event where people come together for 24 hours to make something using the wonders of technology. But, the goal of a hackathon isn't just to create something: it's also to learn. Hackathons are the time to experiment with new technologies, APIs, SDKs, or even learn to code from scratch.</p>

                        <p>None at all. Hackathons are a fantastic place to learn and get advice from experienced hackers. We'll also host plenty of workshops and have plenty of mentors so by the end of the 24 hours you'll have a working project even if you haven't coded a day in your life before. We also host a prize for best beginner hack.</p>

                        <p>A sum total of $0.00. Even meals, snacks, caffeine, sodas, and other drinks are provided. Our goal is to let you hack worry free.</p>

                        <p>You are responsible for finding your own transportation. Ideally, try and find a ride because we don't reccomend driving back for safety reasons after a hackathon. We can help find you a carpool.</p>

                        <p>All accepted hackers will be given an invitation to a Facebook group which can be used to find teammates. Additionally, the event will feature a team-forming event. Obviously, if you have friends going to the event, you are welcome to just team up with them; however, it is often more fun to code with new people.</p>

                        <p>Nope. Because it was our first year last year, we wanted to be cautious for liability reasons. This year everything you'll need to do for liability reasons are part of the application so you won't need to do anything once you are accepted. </p>
